# Nobel Winners

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the worlds most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige 
and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who 
established the prize. Every year it’s given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, 
literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out 
in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it’s not biased. 
There are some years when the Nobel Prizes have not been awarded. Most of them during World War I (1914-1918)
and II (1939-1945). 

A person or organization awarded the Nobel Prize is called Nobel Laureate. The word “laureate” refers to 
being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign 
of honor.

Since the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, 911 laureates or organisations were granted with the prestigious
award. They are distributed in 6 categories: chemistry, economics, literature, medicine, peace, physics. 
In this analysis, we are exploring data from Nobel Laureate Publications from 1901. The data set was obtained 
from TidyTuesday, which includes records for every individual or organization that was awarded the Nobel Prize since 1901.

In this project, I want to explore more about Nobel laureates and try to answer these questions:

Are there gender and age differences or patterns for all Nobel Prize winners?

What is the geographical distribution of all Nobel Prize winners?
